In this repository we have: index.html, styles.css, eye.js.
In index.html write a link in which HTML and CSS are connected.
Inside head tag create div class = "eyes".
Inside eyes div you have to create two more div class = "eye".
In styles.css first write code for body then eyes, eye and ball.
In eyes.js get HTML elements by using getElementsByClassName and use onmousemove function.
